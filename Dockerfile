    # further down) working on the first try and failing with "Unable to locate
    # package" until the agent works out that it has to refresh an index it cannot
    # see. A stale index only bites once a bookworm point release moves a version,
    # and `sudo apt-get update` fixes that.
    #
    # Base runtime + the repo tools loom's agents shell out to. gh/gcloud/docker
    # come from the signed repos configured above; the rest are stock bookworm.
    # The last groups are the everyday dev CLIs an agent reaches for in a checkout —
    # jq/ripgrep/fd for search, build-essential/pkg-config for native builds, a
    # system python3, and the usual archive/editor/pager tools. (cargo, rustc and
    # cc already ship in the rust base image, so they are not repeated here.)
    #
    # bubblewrap + socat are the sandbox the agent runtimes reach for on Linux:
    # Claude Code's sandboxed Bash runs commands under `bwrap` (with `socat`
    # relaying network) and otherwise degrades to unsandboxed with a warning;
    # Codex prefers a system `bwrap` over the one it bundles. Both need the
    # unprivileged user namespaces this container already permits (the
    # SYS_ADMIN + apparmor=unconfined + seccomp=unconfined grants in
    # docker-compose.yml).
    #
    # The remaining tools round out what a general coding agent expects to find:
    # sqlite3 (loom's own store is sqlite; agents inspect/seed .db files),
    # openssh-client (git-over-SSH to non-GitHub remotes; see compose), patch +
    # diffutils (applying diffs when a native edit won't fit), procps (ps/pkill
    # to manage servers an agent spawns), rsync, file, gettext-base (envsubst in
    # CI/templating), and shellcheck (agents lint the shell they write).
    #
    # git-lfs is needed to clone the Hugging Face repos and other LFS-backed
    # checkouts agents work in; without it the pointer files check out instead of
    # the payload. cmake + ninja-build + python3-dev + the -dev libraries are what
    # a source build of a Python C extension asks for when no wheel matches.
    # iproute2 (ss), lsof, netcat-openbsd, dnsutils and strace answer "is the
    # server I just started actually listening, and on what" — the loop an agent
    # runs constantly and cannot run with ps alone. tmux keeps a dev server alive
    # across commands. graphviz renders dot; poppler-utils (pdftotext) reads the

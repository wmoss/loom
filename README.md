# Loom

A lightweight session orchestrator and communication layer for coding agents.

Loom is one binary:

- **`loom`** — the **orchestrator**. It runs the REST + SSE server, hosts a
  Vue dashboard, creates worktrees, launches agents under managed runtime
  supervisors, monitors their lifecycle, and exposes the same registered
  operations through its CLI and MCP adapters. It is the only process that
  opens the sqlite database directly.

`loom` owns the sqlite database at `~/.weaver/weaver.db`; every CLI, MCP, and
browser operation goes through its REST API. There is no separate agent CLI.

## Getting Started

The fastest way in is to **have your coding agent set Loom up for you**: open
this repo in Claude Code (or your agent of choice) and tell it to *"set Loom up
for me — follow the Getting Started steps in the README."* The steps below are
written for it to run; do them yourself if you'd rather.

1. **Build the tooling.** From the repo root:

   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

   This produces `target/debug/loom`.

2. **Put `loom` on the PATH.** Symlink it into a directory already on
   `$PATH` (e.g. `~/.local/bin`), so they stay current as you rebuild:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   ln -sf "$PWD/target/debug/loom"   ~/.local/bin/loom
   ```

   If `~/.local/bin` isn't on your `$PATH`, add it (e.g.
   `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` in your shell profile).

3. **Run the setup wizard.** It seeds a bootstrap operator (the GitHub login
   allowed to sign in first) and optionally registers a GitHub App:

   ```sh
   loom setup
   ```

4. **Start it and open the dashboard.** Locally:

   ```sh
   loom server run     # REST + SSE server, runtime manager, background monitor
   loom open           # open the web UI (http://127.0.0.1:7878)
   ```

   Or under Docker Compose — see [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md):

   ```sh
   loom config render-env         # loom.toml -> deploy/standalone/.env
   cd deploy/standalone
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

Run `loom help` for registered resource groups, `loom <group> --help` for
syntax, `loom help --json` for machine-readable discovery, and inspect the
running server's `/api/operations` or `/api/openapi.json` for its live catalogue.
Every operation is declared exactly once, and its id is its path on disk:
`issues.tags.set` lives in `crates/weaver-api/src/operations/issues/tags/set.rs`
and nowhere else. The REST route, the JSON Schema, the MCP tool, the clap command,
and the authority boundary are all derived from that one declaration — a route is
computed from the id rather than written down, so the two cannot disagree.
Streams and terminal websockets are registered the same way; `io = Stream` /
`io = Duplex` names the response encoding, which is the only thing that differs
about them.
See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the contributor build/test loop.

## Architecture

The `loom` CLI, MCP adapters, and Vue SPA are REST clients; only the server owns
sqlite, worktrees, supervisors, agents, and background services. See
[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the module map, flows, and storage
model. The route catalogue is not prose either: a running loom answers
`GET /api/operations` and `GET /api/openapi.json` with every operation, its
path, actor policy, risk, encoding, and the CLI command and MCP tool it
produces, straight from the declarations in
[`crates/weaver-api/src/operations/`](crates/weaver-api/src/operations).

## Usage

The common operator loop is launch, supervise, review, and archive:

```sh
loom sessions launch "Add a /health endpoint"
loom sessions poll <session>
loom sessions wait <session>
loom sessions send <session> "try the curl again"
loom sessions interrupt <session>
loom sessions url [<session>]
loom sessions archive <session>
```

The task becomes the branch goal and opening prompt; Loom derives the
`weaver/<slug>` branch name and forks from a freshly fetched default branch.
Use `--repo` for another checkout or managed GitHub repository, `--base` to pin
a parent branch, and `--claim` or `--issue` to seed the task from existing work.
Run `loom sessions launch --help` for the complete set of launch flags.

Profiles are reusable templates, not live session configuration. Omitted
selectors inherit from the selected template and agent defaults. The resolver
previews concrete selectors, policy provenance, capacity, and validation before
create. The result is a concrete snapshot stamped for that runtime launch.
Later profile, environment, registry, or default edits cannot silently mutate
it; an explicit handoff can replace it with a newly resolved snapshot. New
Session exposes the same profile picker, editable launch fields, save-as-new
composition, and bounded Scratch drop target as the CLI.

A profile may also carry organization-owned opening instructions. Loom appends
them for every origin that selects the profile: user and delegated launches,
Slack and GitHub triggers, watches, and authenticated automation. This keeps
workflow and response conventions in deployment configuration while Loom's
own prompt supplies only compact session and transport context.

Loom seeds lightweight instructions for an untouched `default` profile and
editable `slack` and `github` starters from the same runtime posture. Their
reviewed source lives under `crates/loom-policy/profiles/<name>/`; trigger
settings continue to select `default` for compatibility until an operator
explicitly selects an origin profile. Deployment configuration can manage and
select those profiles together.

`poll` reads lifecycle and attention, `wait` blocks until completion or human
attention, `send` delivers immediate external control input, and `interrupt`
stops the current turn. For ACP, external input always cancels and restarts;
the conversation composer uses the same stop-and-send behavior so a message
cannot sit behind work the model selected concurrently. Session commands accept
an id, branch id, branch name, or `repo:branch`.

The session title is one canonical, unqualified task label; fleet views add its
Group only when they need a qualified `Group / Task` name. Loom records whether
that label was deterministic, model-generated, human-authored, or issue-owned.
Human and issue labels always take precedence: metadata generation can replace
only an unchanged derived label, or an unchanged generated label after an
explicit regenerate request. Renames use compare-and-swap so a stale tab cannot
overwrite a newer label. Generated labels can be disabled per session.

The dashboard presents the fleet as shared **Spaces → Groups → Sessions**.
Attention, All, and History are smart views over that placement; successful
automation is ordinary work in Ops, while failed reservations remain typed
Interventions. Group rows show the unqualified task label and cross-group views
compose `Group / Task`.

A session opens on Conversation (or Agent for a terminal-backed runtime), with
one Review pane for Artifacts and Changes. Details owns launch metadata,
associations, Scratch, lifecycle actions, profile-first handoff, and the
advanced editor escape hatch. Review comments remain private drafts until one
Submit review action delivers coherent feedback. The Backlog pane supports
stable multi-selection and atomic bulk triage. Destructive actions use
focus-managed in-app confirmation with explicit scope and retryable inline
errors; the SPA never delegates that work to browser prompts.

On return after configured inactivity, Loom may prepare a short source-linked
resumption cue from bounded conversation and immutable artifact inputs. Reading
the cue is model-free; explicit ensure/force actions control generation. Cue and
title assistance run with a cleared environment, no tools, and no MCP. Restricted
session content is excluded unless the operator explicitly enables it, and
source fingerprints prevent stale generated text from overwriting newer state.

`loom sessions url` prints a session's dashboard URL — the link to hand a person,
resolved against loom's externally-visible address (the `auth.base_url` setting,
else the address you reached it on). With no key it is the session you are
running inside, which is how an agent links a PR back to the work behind it.

Channels are the default coordination mechanism. Every session is created with a
same-id channel whose opening goal records its charter. Messages are append-only,
read markers are per participant, and delivery is recorded per server-owned
binding. A Slack-origin session binds its own channel to that thread, so one
idempotent `result` append is both the canonical outcome and the external reply.
The dashboard's Channels pane is a dense split mailbox; `loom channels
list|get|read|send|wait|ack` exposes the same REST model to agents (`ls` remains
an alias for `list`).

Issues remain intentional repository backlog or external mappings.
`source_branch` records provenance;
`claimed_branch` records the branch currently working the issue. Loom's
worktree-facing commands default to this branch's claims plus the unclaimed backlog, while the Loom board
shows the repository. Batch commands use the same atomic API as the Issues pane:
`loom issues close 7 9`, `loom issues reopen 7 9`,
`loom issues tag set 7 9 area ui`,
`loom issues tag delete 7 9 area`, and `loom issues delete 7 9`.
If any ID or precondition is invalid, none of the requested issues changes.

An ordinary launch does not manufacture an issue. `loom sessions launch` prints
the new session/channel id; a parent follows it with `loom channels read
--channel <id>` or blocks with `loom channels wait --channel <id>`. Explicit
`--claim` and GitHub-triggered launches retain a compatibility issue association
because that work item already exists outside the session.

Inside a worktree, the compact agent loop is:

```sh
loom summary
loom status set --tag ok --message "implementing the API"
loom channels read
loom artifacts write design design.md
loom channels send "ready for review"
```

`loom permissions show` reports the session's effective operations and external
repository scope. A session always has App scope for its own repository;
`loom permissions request --help` exposes the durable approval flow for any
other one. That request raises the session's attention and posts to its
channel, so you decide from Session Details in the browser — no shell needed.
A profile that allowlists `owner/*` turns those decisions into a standing
approval for that owner, applied without waiting on you.

## Status & attention

Status has two independent axes.

The **lifecycle** (`session.status`) is mechanical and orchestrator-owned:
`created`, `running`, `orphaned`, `done`, `error`, or `archived`.
ACP turn boundaries and terminal-agent hooks feed one promotion path; supervisor
loss marks a recoverable session orphaned. Runtime permission requests remain in
the ACP Conversation tab rather than becoming guessed lifecycle state.

The **attention** axis is the agent's own signal of whether it needs you:
`ok` (going fine, or blocked on something external like a CI run or PR review),
`attention` (a question, a decision, "ready for review"), or `blocked` (stuck,
needs help). Agents set it with
`loom status set --tag <level> --message "<message>"`, which records both the
level and a one-line current-state message; omitting `--message` changes the
level and keeps the last message. `loom status get` reads the current value. The
dashboard shows both and lets you filter for sessions that need a human.

## Adoption

A session's detached Tapestry runtime supervisor is independent of the loom
daemon: restarting loom leaves it running, though it does not survive a machine
reboot (the sqlite rows and worktrees do). When the monitor finds a session
whose runtime supervisor has vanished, it marks it `orphaned` rather than
`done`.

An orphaned session can be adopted: Loom recreates the stamped runtime and
resumes it through that runtime's recovery contract.

```sh
loom sessions adopt <branch>                  # or the "Adopt" button in the web UI
```

Set `server.auto_adopt` to have loom adopt every recoverable session
automatically on startup (off by default):

```sh
loom config set server.auto_adopt true
```

## Recovery

An ACP provider can stay connected but become unusable, with one failed turn
followed by every new message ending in `error`. The Conversation view renders
the latest error in red and offers **Recover** beside it. Recovery restarts only
that session's provider runtime and reloads its provider conversation; the
worktree, branch, durable journal, and session URL stay in place.

The same action is available outside the browser:

```sh
loom sessions recover <branch>
```

For an archived session, this command retains its existing meaning: rebuild the
kept branch's worktree and resume the agent.

## GitHub

With the `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, loom tracks each live session's
pull request. A background loop batches due branches by repository every minute,
slowing quiet sessions to ten-minute and then hourly refreshes, with an immediate
refresh available from Session **Details**. The dashboard surfaces a link
straight to the PR, its head-update age, its state (open / draft / merged /
closed), the review decision (approved / changes requested / review required),
and a rolled-up CI verdict. Compact rows render CI as `OK` / `TESTING` / `FAILED`
/ `PENDING`; Session **Details** keeps the associations and an immediate
**Refresh** button available without occupying the workbench header.

Every session detail has a **Conversation** tab that renders the agent's chat
with the model — user turns, replies, thinking, and tool calls — live and
(via the archive capture below) still there to review after the terminal is gone.
For ACP sessions, the conversation composer sends immediately: it stops a live
turn and starts the message as the next turn. Feedback queued by another client
stays visible and can be pulled back into the composer with its **Edit** action
or ArrowUp from an empty composer, or sent immediately with **Stop & send**. The
live status names visible thinking, writing, or tool activity and reports how
long it has been since the agent produced an observable update; quiet time is
not guessed to mean stuck. Cross-session `loom sessions send` uses the same
stop-and-send behavior.

Whenever a session is archived — by the Archive button or automatically on merge
— loom first captures that conversation to disk: it finds the agent's transcript
(Claude Code or Codex), normalizes it, and writes a machine-readable `chat.json`
plus a readable `chat.md` under `session.log_dir`
(default `~/.iris/logs/sessions/<branch>/`). `loom sessions transcript`
renders the same local log without contacting the server.

Agents can page or literally search that same normalized history through
session-scoped REST. ACP reads its durable journal; terminal agents normalize
their native transcript on read and use the archived Iris capture as fallback.
The aggregate MCP server exposes `loom.session_history` and
`loom.session_search` as thin structured clients for those routes. See
[Session history and search](docs/session-history.md) for the record, cursor,
source, and authorization contract.

Ordinary sessions are archived after ten days without activity by default. The
GitHub poller checks sessions active within the last ten minutes every minute,
the rest of the first quiet day every ten minutes, and older live sessions every
hour. A merged PR is archived on the next poll for its activity tier. Both paths
tear down the terminal and worktree while keeping the branch and its Loom
history, the same as the Archive button.
Profiles can override the idle interval (an explicit `0` disables that TTL). To
keep one session until you archive it yourself, choose **Disable auto-archive**
from that session's **Details** popover, or set its quiet opt-out label:

```sh
loom sessions tags set auto-archive disabled
loom sessions tags delete auto-archive        # allow automatic archive again
```

The opt-out also applies to automation cleanup and the other background
retention paths; a manual Archive still works. Turn the global merge behaviour
or GitHub polling off in **Settings** or from the CLI:

```sh
loom config set github.archive_on_merge false   # keep the worktree after merge
loom config set github.poll false               # stop polling GitHub entirely
```

Polling is a quiet no-op for repositories without a GitHub remote, or wherever
`gh` is not installed — nothing to configure to opt out there.

### Trigger sessions from issues

Include **`@loom`** in a GitHub issue body, issue/PR comment, or submitted PR
review, or add the mention later by editing an issue or comment body, and loom
launches a session against that repo, seeded from the issue, then replies with a
link to it. GitHub delivers the request to
`POST /api/github/webhook`, which verifies the delivery's HMAC signature and
authorizes the requester against the **approved-user allowlist** (the same
people who can sign in to loom — repo write access is not itself a grant). Set
`LOOM_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and point a repo/org webhook at
`{base}/api/github/webhook` (issues, issue-comment, and pull-request-review
events, `application/json`). See
[docs/github-trigger.md](docs/github-trigger.md).

## Server address

`loom server run` binds `127.0.0.1:7878` by default. The running daemon records
the address it bound in `~/.weaver/server.json`, so the `loom` CLI finds a local
server with no configuration. Named contexts make switching between local and
remote servers explicit:

```sh
loom context add local --url http://127.0.0.1:7878
loom login production --url https://loom.oa.dev
loom context ls
loom context use production
loom --context local session ls
```

`loom login` validates a personal API token before storing it. The prompt is
hidden; use `--token-stdin` when a password manager supplies the token. Context
endpoints live in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/loom/config.toml` (normally
`~/.config/loom/config.toml`) and tokens live separately in
`credentials.toml`, which is mode 0600. A repository may select one of the
user's contexts by committing `.loom/client.toml`:

```toml
context = "production"
```

Repository configuration names a context but cannot provide an endpoint or
credential. Selection order is `--context`, `WEAVER_API`, `LOOM_CONTEXT`, the
repository selector, the user's default context, then the recorded local
server. `LOOM_TOKEN` overrides a saved context credential unless `--context`
selects a different endpoint than `WEAVER_API`; this prevents an injected local
machine token from being sent to a remote server. `loom context current` shows
what the current directory selects.

## Authentication

loom can be exposed off `127.0.0.1` so the dashboard and the API are reachable
without an SSH tunnel — `loom server run --addr 0.0.0.0:7878`, ideally behind a
TLS-terminating reverse proxy. Access is then gated three ways:

- **Local use needs nothing in single-user mode.** Requests from the loopback
  interface are trusted as the machine owner, so the local `loom` CLI, the
  agent, and watch scripts work with zero configuration. Organization
  authorization disables loopback and machine-token impersonation; local
  callers then use an ordinary user or session credential.
- **GitHub or password login** for the web UI. The login screen offers
  "Continue with GitHub" once an OAuth app is configured, plus username/password.
  A fresh install approves exactly one user — whichever GitHub login and
  immutable numeric id you set as `LOOM_OWNER_GITHUB` and
  `LOOM_OWNER_GITHUB_ID` before first run. There is no default; leave the login
  unset and no owner is seeded, so GitHub sign-in won't work until it's set. Add more
  users and roles under **Settings → People & security**, set your password
  under **Settings → Account**, and configure GitHub sign-in under **Settings →
  Integrations**. A deployment can set
  `auth.github_organizations` to let active members of named GitHub
  organizations sign in with a renewable one-hour authorization; the GitHub
  App needs the **Members: Read-only** organization permission.
- **Personal API tokens** for remote CLIs and other trusted clients. Mint one
  under **Settings → Account** or from a locally authenticated CLI:

  ```sh
  loom token add laptop --expires-days 30  # prints the secret once
  ```

  Then sign in once from the remote machine:

  ```sh
  loom login production --url https://loom.example.com
  loom sessions launch "Investigate the failing test in #123"
  ```

  For an ephemeral environment, the environment-variable form remains
  available:

  ```sh
  export WEAVER_API=https://loom.example.com
  export LOOM_TOKEN=loom_xxxxxxxx
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOM_TOKEN" \
       -H 'content-type: application/json' \
       "$WEAVER_API/api/sessions/launch" -d '{"cwd":"/srv/repo","goal":"..."}'
  ```

- **Federated workflow tokens** for GitHub Actions and Google workloads. Loom
  verifies the workload's OIDC identity and returns an automation-scoped token
  with a fixed ten-minute lifetime. The workflow exchanges again for each run;
  it does not store a personal token or choose one of the day-based lifetimes
  shown on the personal-token page. The CLI reads the OIDC token from stdin and
  can create the run directly, so workflow tokens never need to appear in
  command arguments and callers do not need to assemble Loom HTTP requests:

  ```sh
  echo "::add-mask::$oidc_token"
  loom_token=$(printf '%s' "$oidc_token" |
    WEAVER_API="$LOOM_URL" loom auth federate | jq -er .token)
  echo "::add-mask::$loom_token"

  WEAVER_API="$LOOM_URL" LOOM_TOKEN="$loom_token" loom runs create \
    --profile github_comment \
    --idempotency-key "prose-cleanup:issue:123:$body_hash" \
    --session "$(jq -cn --arg repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" \
      --arg goal 'Clean up issue prose' \
      '{repo:$repo,title:"Prose cleanup",goal:$goal,github_issue:123}')"
  ```

  See
  [Restricted sessions](docs/restricted-sessions.md).

To configure **GitHub sign-in**: register an OAuth app on GitHub with the
callback `https://loom.example.com/api/auth/github/callback`, then paste its
client id and secret into Settings → Integrations (or set `LOOM_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` /
`LOOM_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`).

Behind a **same-host reverse proxy** the proxy's forwarded requests appear to
come from loopback, so set `auth.trust_loopback false` and `auth.cookie_secure
true`. Local automation keeps working: loom mints a machine-local token (at
`~/.weaver/loom-token`, mode 0600) and hands it to its own subprocesses, so only
genuinely remote callers need to present a token or log in. Once
`auth.github_organizations` has been enabled, Loom permanently latches that
database into shared-deployment mode and ignores both loopback trust and the
machine-local token; every request instead resolves to a manual user or an
organization-authorized user with a current lease.

## Configuration

General settings and named launch profiles have separate ownership. Settings
control the server and shared services. Profiles control agent selection,
runtime policy, capacity, environment posture, MCP access, and opening
instructions. Edit both in
Settings or use the operator CLI:

```sh
loom settings list
loom profiles ls
loom profile show default
loom profile show ops --effective
loom mcps get
loom mcp show loom/github/comment@v1
loom profile add ops --agent codex --mcp github,messaging
loom mcp add /engineering/search/docs --label "Docs search" \
  --file server.py --tests test_mcp.py
```

Strict profiles reject one-launch overrides. Environment-cleared profiles start
from a minimal baseline plus explicit ambient, profile, and repository values.
Environment reads expose names and source metadata, never literal secret values.
GitHub client credentials are selected by Loom: an ordinary interactive session
prefers its launching user's optional Account PAT and otherwise uses the
profile's allowlisted GitHub App access. The image's Git credential helper and
`gh` wrapper consume that session selection.

MCP selection is provider-neutral: `none`, `all`, or named groups. Saving a
profile pins exact capability identities and revisions; registry edits cannot
silently widen saved profiles or running sessions. Custom MCP programs are
validated administrator code, not a sandbox. See
[MCP and profile control plane](docs/mcp-profiles.md).

Restricted automation profiles additionally suppress repository-controlled
configuration, expose only stamped tools, reject unmatched permission requests,
and keep provider credentials server-side. See
[Restricted sessions](docs/restricted-sessions.md).

The complete setting registry is self-documenting in Settings and
`loom settings list`. Environment variables and runtime defaults are catalogued in
[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#environment); standalone deployment values
live in [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md). Registered settings share one
[configuration precedence policy](docs/configuration.md): runtime override →
deployment default → built-in default.

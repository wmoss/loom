//! Tapestry — a barebones per-session terminal supervisor; loom's native
//! terminal backend.
//!
//! Each session is one tiny **detached supervisor process** that owns the
//! agent's PTY, runs a vt100 screen emulator, and serves a unix control socket.
//! Because the supervisor's lifetime is independent of `loom server run`, restarting
//! loom leaves a live agent untouched (the recovery property loom relies on),
//! while the interactive surface streams *raw PTY bytes*, so an attached xterm
//! owns its own scrollback, selection, and search rather than a server-rendered
//! screen.
//!
//! ## Surface
//!
//! * [`spawn_detached`] — launch a session's supervisor in its own session, so
//!   it outlives the launcher.
//! * [`Client`] — drive a session: [`Client::is_alive`], [`Client::capture`],
//!   [`Client::send`], [`Client::resize`], [`Client::derive`], [`Client::kill`],
//!   and the interactive [`Client::attach`].
//! * [`list_sessions`] — every session with a live supervisor.
//! * [`supervisor::run`] — the supervisor event loop (the `tapestry supervise`
//!   binary entry point; tests call it in-process).

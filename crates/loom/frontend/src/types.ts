// What the server declares, the server generates: every DTO the API returns or
// accepts now lives in `api/generated.ts`, which
// `cargo run -p weaver-api --bin generate-types` writes from the OpenAPI document
// `/api/openapi.json` serves. This file used to restate all of them by hand,
// which is exactly how a mirror drifts.
//
// Two things are left here, and nothing else belongs:
//
//  1. **Names.** Rust spells its wire types `SessionView`, `ReviewDto`,
//     `TagView`; the SPA has always spelled them `Session`, `Review`, `Tag`.
//     The re-export block below is that mapping, in one place, and it is the
//     only thing standing between a renamed Rust DTO and a compile error here.
//  2. **Decodes of opaque JSON.** A handful of fields are `serde_json::Value`
//     on the wire — a chat block's `payload`, a watch's `trigger`/`scope`, the
//     ACP adapter's command and configuration metadata — so the generated type
//     for them is `unknown`, correctly. The browser is the only thing that
//     knows their shape, so the shapes stay here. Same for the `sessions.chat`
//     SSE frames, which are not an operation's `Output` at all, and for the
//     error bodies an `ApiError` carries.
//
// Anything you are tempted to add here that an operation already declares
// belongs in the Rust DTO instead — then regenerate.

//! Loom's server, public CLI, and transport adapters.
//!
//! Loom owns sessions (one terminal supervisor + one running agent per branch),
//! the REST API, the Vue web UI, the monitor loop, and recently-used repository
//! bookkeeping. `loom` is the single public command-line interface; its
//! host-facing and worktree-facing commands are clients of the same REST API.
//!
//! This crate is the HTTP/SSE/WebSocket adapter and the CLI. The engine beneath
//! it is split by persistent store, agent mechanism, policy, editor, forge,
//! launch, background-watch, and delivery subjects. Each layer is re-exported
//! here, so `loom::session`, `loom::AppState` and friends keep stable paths.

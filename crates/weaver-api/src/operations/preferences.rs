//! Per-operator UI preferences (terminal theme/font/size and the session-list
//! filter/sort selections) — a small, fixed-key personal override layered over
//! the effective inherited value.
//!
//! Distinct from `settings.*`: those are server-wide runtime configuration
//! with an admin-gated write (`settings.patch` is `actor = Admin`). This is
//! read/write by any signed-in human about their own account only.

//! Agent runtimes: the picker list (builtins + operator-defined custom
//! agents) and the custom-agent editor's CRUD.
//!
//! `agents.list` is a plain fleet-wide read, `actor = SessionSelf`. Defining,
//! editing, and removing a custom agent are different in kind — `actor =
//! Admin` — since this is fleet configuration (which runtimes exist at all),
//! not a per-branch action a signed-in user takes on their own behalf,
//! exactly like `watches.create`.

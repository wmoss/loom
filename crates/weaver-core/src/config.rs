//! Layered key/value settings.
//!
//! Runtime overrides live in `settings`, infrastructure-provided defaults live
//! in `deployment_settings`, and reads resolve in that order before the
//! built-in default. Every setting weaver knows about is declared in
//! [`REGISTRY`] — a single source of truth that gives each key a label, help
//! text, type, default, and group. The registry drives validation
//! ([`validate`]) and the settings pane in the web UI ([`describe`]); the raw
//! [`get`]/[`apply`] helpers still accept arbitrary runtime keys so nothing
//! breaks if a setting is read before it is registered.

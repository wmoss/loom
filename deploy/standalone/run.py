"""Bring the standalone Loom Compose stack up with one command.

It does the two manual steps for you: render deploy/standalone/.env from your
loom.toml, then `docker compose up -d --build` here. With --local it targets
LOOM_DOMAIN=localhost, so Caddy signs with its own internal CA (self-signed —
the browser warns, expected) and you can exercise the real three-service stack
(Caddy + loom-init + loom) on your own machine before pointing DNS at a server.

Why .env lives next to the compose file (a common question): docker compose
auto-loads `.env` from the compose project directory and uses it both to
interpolate the compose file (${LOOM_DOMAIN}, ${LOOM_IMAGE}) and as each
service's `env_file:`. It has to sit here, beside docker-compose.yml — this
script writes it there so you don't have to think about the path.
